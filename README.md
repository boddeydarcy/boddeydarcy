# Hello There 👋 
👨‍🎓 I am Darcy Boddey, a third year student pursuing his degree in Software Engineering<br>at the University of Leicester.<br><br>👨‍💻 I enjoy coding on JetBrains products as their IDE's enhance my enjoyment of coding <br>whilst using their softwares. I feel that the efficiency of their softwares are enhanced by<br>my ability to touch type.<br><br>🏋️‍♂️ Outside of my studies I spend my free time working out alongside playing sports, <br> this is a great boost to my mental and physical health. As well as playing sports, I love <br> to watch Football and Formula 1.<br><br>🎥 I would love to start creating content on my Software Engineering journey as it I have <br>always been passionate about expressing myself through creative videography.<br><br>🛫 My first language is English however, I am picking up Spanish in order to be able to<br>communicate with a broader group of people.
